    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my go-to unexpected side for Thanksgiving and other pot-lucks. Aside from being gorgeous, it holds up well when made ahead, tastes great at room temp, and appeals to lots of eaters because it's vegan, paleo, gluten-free, and low-carb friendly. The only thing that takes time is deconstructing the Brussels sprouts. The salad keeps in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup light olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups pistachio nuts</li>
        <li>½ cup dried cranberries</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. </li>
    <li>Mix together sugar and oil in a large bowl until well blended. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts, then beat in eggs. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg mixture until combined. Fold in pistachios and cranberries by hand. </li>
    <li>Divide dough in half. Form each piece into a 12x2-inch log on the prepared cookie sheet. Dough may be sticky; wet hands with cool water to handle dough more easily. </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until logs are light brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes. </li>
    <li>Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Cut logs on the diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Lay cookies cut-side down on the cookie sheet. </li>
    <li>Bake cookies until dry, 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
</ol>
